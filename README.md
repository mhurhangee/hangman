# Hangman
My first python terminal game built from scratch.

A version of hangman that is playable in a python terminal.

## Instructions
Run the script and enter Y or yes to play.  The script randomly chooses a word from a list for you to guess and you can pick the number of lives.

As per the usual rules of hangman, you guess one letter at a time, until either you have guessed the word correctly, or, the man has been hanged. The terminal self clears after each round to make the game clearer but previous guesses redisplayed.

Win or lose you can play again or exit.
